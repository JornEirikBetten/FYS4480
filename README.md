# FYS4480: Quantum mechanics for many-particle systems

## First Midterm
Contains work related to the helium and beryllium atoms. It contains ground state energy calculations using an FCI-like method where only one-particle-one-hole excitations are relevant, which I called CI1p1h, and a Hartree-Fock calculation of the ground state energy.

## Second Midterm
Contains work related to a Pairing model, with FCI calculations, CID calculations and Rayleigh-Schroedinger perturbation theory of 0th-4th order, and comparisons between the different methods.
