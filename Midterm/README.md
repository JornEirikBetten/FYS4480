# Midterm

## State
Object that takes in a ground state ansatz in a hydrogen-like basis set for single-particle functions, and returns all possible singly-excited states. It also is able to calculate what I call the CI1p1h energies of the system.

## Quantum state
Object that takes in a bit string and converts it into particle-hole formalism.

## Reformatter
Object that reformats interactions.

## HF
Object that performs Hartree-Fock calculations given a ground state ansatz, and tabulated values for the electron-electron interactions.

### Helium calculations
CI1p1h: He.py command: python3 He.py \
HF: HeHF.py command: python3 HeHF.py \

### Beryllium calculations
CI1p1h: Be.py command: python3 Be.py \
HF: BeHF.py command: python3 BeHF.py \
